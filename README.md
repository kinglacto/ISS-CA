1) Added a colon (:) on line 1 to correctly define the function.  
2) Used `==` as a comparison operator instead of `=` on line 3.  
3) Corrected the same issue on line 4 by ensuring `==` is used for comparison.  
4) Fixed a typo where exponentiation should be `**` instead of `***`.  
5) Corrected the function call `narc(start, end)` to properly pass two arguments instead of the incorrect `start end`.  
6) Added a colon (:) at the end of the function definition to properly indicate the start of the function, preventing an indentation error on line 10.  
7) Applied the same fix as point 6 on line 13.  
8) Renamed the function call to `is_narc` to reference the intended function instead of an undefined one, preventing an error.  
9) Reapplied the fix from line 6 to line 13.  
10) Updated the function call on line 16 to correctly reference `print_narcis_numbers` so that the intended function runs properly.
